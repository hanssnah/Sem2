1. why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before doing anything else?
   Because operators need to check which is the current obejct and clear the values in the current object.

2. List how you avoided duplication of code
   setEnpty(), isValid(), isEmpty(), validation codes...

3. List what you have learned in completing this workshop.
   I've learned how to create the deconstructor and how to efficially make the overloaded functions or operators.
