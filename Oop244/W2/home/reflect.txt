1. 'New' keyword of C++ is not capable to resize existing array.
    When resizing is attempted based on the existing allocated memory, the data
    in an array which was populated previously canno be ensured on the memory
2. Becasue the name has not been allocated by new, We dont need to delete the
   part of an array.
3. The compiler looks at the parameter of the function. If the parameter matches
   with the first one, it will call the first one and if it matches with second,
   it will call the second function.
4. I've learned how to dynamically allocate memory in c++ and how function-
   overload system is working in this workshop. Also, this workshop helps me 
   to practice the c++ syntax and functions.
