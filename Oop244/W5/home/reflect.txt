1. The operator+ returns a Fraction object. Explain why this operator should not return a fefernce to a Fraction object.
because this operator wants to return a copy of the current object before any changes takes effect.

2. List the temporary objects in the teser module
 a)opers inside of operator+ , operator*. operator!=, operator+=, operator==

3.List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize duplication
 I simplifided my operators to use the other operators. 
 operator!= is not equal to == 
 operator+= is addition of objects.

4. Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
I've learned how to overload operators and how to create its.
Also, I've learned a class can be a return type and it has differenct meaning in post_fix and pre_fix.
