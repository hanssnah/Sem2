1. What is a safe empty state? Could you define another state as the safe empty state?
  A safe empty state is literally nothing in the variable. We can state a safe empty state as variable's pointer = '\0'.

2. Describe how you have minimized code duplication.
 I've literated the same code which is initializing empty string.

3. Explain why the canTravelWith(...) member function can access the private data of the object referenced in its parameter.
The 'const' feature allows to access private data in object. This is different with friend function. It can't change original value.

4. What statement do you need to add to ensure that the strncpy(...) function executes correctly?
I added the maximam length of string as a third parameter which is bigger than the other two parameters' addition.

5. Explain what you have learned in this workshop

I've learnd how to state a safe empty state. Also, I've learned about c++ class's constructor's proper way to use.
