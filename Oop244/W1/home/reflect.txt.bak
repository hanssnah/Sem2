1. Namespace is a cpp feature which is able to avoid naming conflicts. Developers can protect their function to include their function inside of a namespace.
2. Headerfiles can help to organize the code and easy to manage the code. Developer can divide the function's declaration and definition part.
3. We already contains header files inside of the cpp files.
4. If we include cpp file in the other cpp file that means we need to compile twice if we have some error inside of them.
5. I've learned what modules is and some different syntax and functions(objects) between c languages. Also, I've learned how to use namespace inside of the code and how it works.
